# ifclite
ifclite provides a library to create C++ interfaces from EXPRESS - ISO 10303-1 data files and functionality to write ISO-10303-21 STEP files from these interfaces. Main goal is to enable the generation of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files, though interfaces for other kind of definitions could easily also be generated.

A major architectural goal was to set up the interfaces as simple as possible with minium footprint. So, for example, the interfaces generated by the EXPRESS parser are header only interfaces, thus no object files are required to be linked against in application code. Just include the headers. This also holds for all the functionality writing STEP files. The classes utilize C++ templates with all functionality available in the headers.
